<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
  AMAT&nbsp;540&nbsp;A&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;B, or permission of instructor.
</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course could be called AMAT&nbsp;540&nbsp;C, since it’s an ideal follow-up to&nbsp;540&nbsp;B.
  We will learn the following topics, with many examples and applications throughout:
  cohomology groups, universal coefficient theorem, cup products, cohomology rings, K&uuml;nneth theorem, and Poicar&eacute; duality.
  Depending on the participants’ interests, we will also explore some of the following additional topics:
  de&nbsp;Rham theorem, relation to stable homotopy theory, cohomology operations, and other cohomology theories.
</p>
<h2>Textbooks</h2>
<p>
  None will be followed closely&mdash;but the following two books, which are both freely available online and can be purchased for about $30 each, are excellent references:

  <br/>
  New York State Education Law (<a class="printurl" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EDN/224-A">Section 224-A</a>) requires campuses to excuse, without penalty, individual students absent because of religious beliefs, and to provide equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. I will work directly with you to accommodate religious observances, provided that you notify me in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>
  Reasonable accommodations will be provided for students with documented physical, sensory, systemic, medical, cognitive, learning, and mental health (psychiatric) disabilities.
  If you believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class, please notify the <a class="printurl" href="https://www.albany.edu/disability/">Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services</a> (<a href="mailto:daiss@albany.edu">daiss@albany.edu</a>).
  Upon verification and after the registration process is complete, the DAISS will provide you with a letter that informs me that you are a student with a disability registered with the DAISS and lists the recommended reasonable accommodations.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, you are expected to follow the University&rsquo;s <a class="printurl" href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity">Standards of Academic Integrity</a> and <a class="printurl" href="https://www.albany.edu/health_center/medicalexcuse.shtml">Medical Excuse Policies</a>.
