</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course is designed to provide a supervised independent learning experience to approximate a research experience. The student researches 2–3 topics in the mathematical literature and reports their findings in the form of an integrative presentation in front of peers and faculty, mimicking the work of a mathematician in an academic or industrial setting.
  Successful completion of this course is enough to satisfy the capstone experience requirement for the Master’s (MA) Degree in Mathematics.
  (See the <a class="printurl" href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/mathematics_statistics_ma_degree.htm">University Graduate Bulletin</a>).

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  Presentations (50%) and class participation (50%).

  New York State Education Law (<a class="printurl" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EDN/224-A">Section 224-A</a>) requires campuses to excuse, without penalty, individual students absent because of religious beliefs, and to provide equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. I will work directly with you to accommodate religious observances, provided that you notify me in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>
  Reasonable accommodations will be provided for students with documented physical, sensory, systemic, medical, cognitive, learning, and mental health (psychiatric) disabilities.
  If you believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class, please notify the <a class="printurl" href="https://www.albany.edu/dean-students/disability">Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services</a> (<a href="mailto:daiss@albany.edu">daiss@albany.edu</a>).
  Upon verification and after the registration process is complete, the DAISS will provide you with a letter that informs me that you are a student with a disability registered with the DAISS and lists the recommended reasonable accommodations.

  In all cases the work missed through absence must be made up. However, permission to make up such work is not automatic and is given at the discretion of the instructor.
