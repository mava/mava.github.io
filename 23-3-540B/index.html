  New York State Education Law (<a class="printurl" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EDN/224-A">Section 224-A</a>) requires campuses to excuse, without penalty, individual students absent because of religious beliefs, and to provide equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. I will work directly with you to accommodate religious observances, provided that you notify me in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>
  Reasonable accommodations will be provided for students with documented physical, sensory, systemic, medical, cognitive, learning, and mental health (psychiatric) disabilities.
  If you believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class, please notify the <a class="printurl" href="https://www.albany.edu/disability/">Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services</a> (<a href="mailto:daiss@albany.edu">daiss@albany.edu</a>).
  Upon verification and after the registration process is complete, the DAISS will provide you with a letter that informs me that you are a student with a disability registered with the DAISS and lists the recommended reasonable accommodations.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, you are expected to follow the University&rsquo;s <a class="printurl" href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity">Standards of Academic Integrity</a>.
